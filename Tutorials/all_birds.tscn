As I told you before, the starling is a very skilled bird, combining the skills of the thrush, the mockingbird and the bluebird. The only thing the starling can't do is to ignore other birds. On the other hand, the kestrel is the oposite, it can only ignore others and nothing else. When these two team up they become unstoppable, they can do anything and find any other bird. Now, using only these two, go ahead and find all other 15 birds I've taught you."
